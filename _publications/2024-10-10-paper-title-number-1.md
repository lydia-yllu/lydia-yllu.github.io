excerpt: 'This paper is the first to use the Diffusion Model in the video polyp segmentation task, which has two major challenges, namely, high polyp concealment and difficult to utilize the temporal information. The project requires designing the network framework, writing the experimental code on PyTorch framework, as well as completing the data processing, comparative experiments, and writing the paper.'

This paper is the first to use the Diffusion Model in the video polyp segmentation task, which has two major challenges, namely, high polyp concealment and difficult to utilize the temporal information. The project requires designing the network framework, writing the experimental code on PyTorch framework, as well as completing the data processing, comparative experiments, and writing the paper.
